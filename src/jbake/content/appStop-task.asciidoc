appStop sends "stop" command to a running servlet-container process.

== Syntax

[source,bash]
----
gradle appStop
----

== Effects

appStop does not build source code, it only sends "stop" command to localhost:link:Gretty-configuration.html#_serviceport[servicePort]. Usually appStop is used to stop servlet-container process started by appStart[War][Debug].

== Instantiation and extension

The object called appStop is actually an instance of link:Gretty-task-classes.html#_appstoptask[AppStopTask] class, created and configured for you by Gretty. You can instantiate or even extend this class on your own:

[source,groovy]
----
apply plugin: 'org.gretty'

import org.akhikhl.gretty.AppStopTask

task('MyStop', type: AppStopTask) {
  // ...
}

class VerySpecialStop extends AppStopTask {
  // ...
}

task('MyStop2', type: VerySpecialStop) {
  // ...
}
----

If you are going to instantiate or extend this task class yourself, make sure you've learned it's properties and methods.
