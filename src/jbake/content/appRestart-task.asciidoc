appRestart sends "restart" command to a running servlet-container process.

== Syntax

[source,bash]
----
gradle appRestart
----

== Effects

appRestart does not build source code, it only sends "restart" command to localhost:link:Gretty-configuration.html#_serviceport[servicePort]. Usually
appRestart is used to restart servlet-container process started by appStart[War][Debug].

== Instantiation and extension

The object called appRestart is actually an instance of link:Gretty-task-classes.html#_apprestarttask[AppRestartTask] class, created and configured for you by Gretty. You can instantiate or even extend this class on your own:

[source,groovy]
----
apply plugin: 'org.gretty'

import org.akhikhl.gretty.AppRestartTask

task('MyRestart', type: AppRestartTask) {
  // ...
}

class VerySpecialRestart extends AppRestartTask {
  // ...
}

task('MyRestart2', type: VerySpecialRestart) {
  // ...
}
----

If you are going to instantiate or extend this task class yourself, make sure you've learned it's properties and methods.
