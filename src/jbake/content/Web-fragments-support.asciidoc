Gretty supports META-INF/web-fragment.xml and META-INF/resources in dependency libraries - both for inplace and WAR tasks.

NOTE: web fragments feature was introduced in servlet 3.0 specification, therefore it is not available with jetty 7.

Gretty sources contain example programs, demonstrating use of web-fragments:
