Since version 1.1.2 Gretty can filter files in "src/main/webapp" the same way as processResources can filter files in "src/main/resources".

== Syntax

[source,groovy]
----
gretty {
  webappCopy { CopySpec copySpec ->
     // ...
  }
}
----

here webappCopy is a closure, accepting org.gradle.api.file.CopySpec as a parameter.

== Effects

webappCopy closure is automatically invoked when:

- gradle performs one of Gretty run tasks
- gradle builds WAR file
- gradle builds a link:Product-generation.html[product]

TIP: There's no need to duplicate CopySpec-specific code in gretty and War task. You can hold all filtering code in gretty.webappCopy. Gretty automatically reconfigures War task with gretty.webappCopy.

Gretty sources contain https://github.com/gretty-gradle-plugin/gretty/tree/master/examples/filterWebapp[example program] demonstrating web-app filtering at work.
